# HexWorld
The HexWorld online LAN java civilization-building game.
In HexWorld, you assume the role of the leader of an empire. Start out with a tiny chunk of land and work your way up to conquering the world. Upgrade your actions, acquire resources, and pick a path for your people. Ward off other players interested in grabbing your land and ally. HexWorld is an open-ended game of world conquest, written entirely in java.

## How To Play
The instructions to play HexWorld are included with the game.

## Setup
You will require somewhere to host the server (it runs on java) and as many players as you like. The game works best with ~6-12 players.  
From there, just run the server. The players then join in by running their HexNet programs, which are compatible with all Hexagon java games. You will need the IP of the host.  

## Included Files
HexWorldServer.java : The server. Run this on your computer (or wherever) and have users connect to it.  
Empire.java : Class used frequently in HexWorldServer.java which stores each player's data.
